          <h2>Compare Both Jobs </h2>
          <p>Both Pay Well</p>
          <p> Both are junior type roles</p>
          <p>Both based in London</p>
          <p> One needs 2 years experience the other only knoweldge. Very simmilar distance between the two companies is going to make little difference and the fact the jobs dont pay a simmilar wage could make a difference. The BBC pays £31,000 whereas the Preffered Choice Ltd pays £50,000. this will definatly influence who goes for what job. But overall they are quite simmilar.  </p>
